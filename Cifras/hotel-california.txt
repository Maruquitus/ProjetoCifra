Hotel California
Bm

<b>Bm</b>
   On a dark desert highway
<b>F#7</b>
    Cool wind in my hair
<b>A</b>
  Warm smell of colitas
<b>E7</b>
   Rising up through the air
<b>G</b>
  Up ahead in the distance
<b>D</b>
  I saw a shimmering light
<b>Em</b>
   My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
<b>F#7</b>
    I had to stop for the night

[Segunda Parte]

<b>Bm</b>
   There she stood in the doorway
<b>F#7</b>
    I heard the mission bell
<b>A</b>
  And I was thinking to myself
<b>E7</b>
   This could be Heaven or this could be Hell
<b>G</b>
  Then she lit up a candle
<b>D</b>
  And she showed me the way
<b>Em</b>
   There were voices down the corridor
<b>F#7</b>
    I thought I heard them say

Such a lovely face

Plenty of room at the Hotel California
     <b>Em</b>

         <b>F#7</b>
You can find us here

Segunda parte - repete dedilhado

[Primeira Parte]

<b>Bm</b>
   Her mind is Tiffany-twisted
<b>F#7</b>
    She got the Mercedes-Benz
<b>A</b>
  She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys
<b>E</b>
  That she calls friends
<b>G</b>
  How they dance in the courtyard
  <b>D</b>
Sweet summer sweat
<b>Em</b>
   Some dance to remember
<b>F#7</b>
    Some dance to forget

[Segunda Parte]

<b>Bm</b>
   So I called up the Captain
<b>F#7</b>
    Please bring me my wine, he said
<b>A</b>
  We haven't had that spirit here since
<b>E</b>
  Nineteen sixty-nine
<b>G</b>                                          
  And still those voices are calling from far
<b>D</b>
 away
<b>Em</b>
   Wake you up in the middle of the night
<b>F#7</b>
    Just to hear them say

[Refrão]

 <b>G</b>                        <b>D</b>
Welcome to the Hotel California
        <b>F#7</b>
Such a lovely place

 <b>Bm</b>
Such a lovely face
 <b>G</b>                                   <b>D</b>
We're livin' it up at the Hotel California
        <b>Em</b>
What a nice surprise
           <b>F#7</b>
Bring your alibis

[Terceira Parte]

[Primeira estrofe - pausa]

<b>Bm</b>
   Mirrors on the ceiling
<b>F#7</b>
    The pink champagne on ice, and she said
<b>A</b>
  We are all just prisoners here
<b>E</b>
  Of our own device
<b>G</b>
  And in the master's chambers
<b>D</b>
  They gathered for the feast
<b>Em</b>
   The stab it with their steely knives
          <b>F#7</b>
But they just can't kill the beast

[Segunda Parte]

<b>Bm</b>
   Last thing I remember, I was
<b>F#7</b>
    Running for the door
<b>A</b>
  I had to find the passage back
         <b>E</b>
To the place I was before
<b>G</b>
  Relax, said the night man
   <b>D</b>
We are programmed to receive
<b>Em</b>
   You can check out any time you like
         <b>F#7</b>
But you can never leave
