My heart's a stereo, it beats for you so 
            <b>D</b>
listen close. Hear my thoughts in
   <b>A</b>    <b>E</b>
every no-oh-ote...
<b>F#m</b> <b>D</b>      <b>A</b>         <b>E</b>         <b>F#m</b>    
Make me your radio, turn me up when you 
   <b>D</b>
feel low. This melody was meant for
<b>A</b>          <b>E</b>
you, just sing along to my stereo.

Verso:
( <b>F#m</b>   <b>D</b>  <b>A</b>  <b>E</b> )
If I was just another dusty record on the 
shelf, will you blow me off and play me
just like everybody else?
If I ask you to scratch my back could you 
manage that? Furthermore, I apologize
for any skipping tracks.
It's just the last girl that play me left a
 couple cracks. I used to, used to,
used to, used to now I'm over that,
'cuz holding grudges over love is ancient 
artifacts. If I could only find a note
to make you understand...
I sing a song and the image grab me by the 
hands. keep myself inside your head
like your favorite tune,
and know my heart's a stereo that only 
plays for you.

If I wasn't old school, fifty pound boombox
 - would you hold me on your shoulder
wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the
 cops and crank it higher everytime
they told you to stop?
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at 
me, when you have to purchase mad D
batteries.
Appreciate every mix tape your friends 
make. You never know when we come and go
like we're on the interstate.
I think I finally found a note to make you 
understand. If you hear this, sing
along and take me by the hands.
Keep myself inside your head like your 
favorite tune, and know my heart is a
stereo that only plays for you.
